There are a few log crossings for the brave of heart (wait till you see them) and a few that I can cross (in other words, up to one foot-don't laugh). There is already erosion so its good not to ride this trail in the rain.  Kent has marked off a new trail at Lake Johnson. You can get there by staying on the paved path starting at the hilly side of the lake. Follow the paved path through the two large hills and start looking to the right as the paved path meets up with the loop on the left. There is an existing trail on the right that leads to Lake Dam Rd. Follow the trail approximately 1/4 mile and start looking for the bright pink markers on your left. The trail winds through a wooded meadow and ends up on a gravel road. Follow the gravel road to the right and it will take you to Lake Dam Rd. Go left on Lake Dam to the entrance of the park. A trail will soon be marked to get from the gravel road to the main part of Lake Johnson so you wont have to go back out to Lake Dam Rd. The new trail is fun and will eventually provide Lake Johnson with a full Loop ride instead of an out and back route.

That makes for some dicey moments if you're flying down at warp speed and you don't know where the roots and rocks are.  The Timber Ridge to Wolf Ridge to Lynn trail descent is scary steep in places and has some very tight singletrack.  If you take Wolf all the way down, or Timber Ridge, or the Sand Springs Mountain trail that lies between, you will arrive at Tillman road.  Take this back north to Briery Branch Road to then head back up a couple miles to the parking area.  Tillman Road turns into Tighlman Road, which can be confusing; don't worry, you're on the right path either way.  If you want to take Timber Ridge all the way down (recommended for the last couple miles), make sure you don't miss the fork right at the intersection with Sand Springs Mountain.
